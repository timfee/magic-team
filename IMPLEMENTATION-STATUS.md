## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Progressive Enhancement
‚úÖ **All features work without real-time** - Server Actions handle all mutations
‚úÖ **Socket.io adds real-time enhancements** - Instant updates for other users
‚úÖ **Polling fallback** - Automatic degradation if WebSockets fail
‚úÖ **Manual refresh** - Always available as last resort

### Data Flow
1. **User action** ‚Üí Optimistic UI update (instant feedback)
2. **Server Action** ‚Üí Database mutation (reliable)
3. **Socket.io broadcast** ‚Üí Other users see update (real-time)
4. **Fallback** ‚Üí Page refresh if Socket.io unavailable

### Security
- ‚úÖ OAuth at audience level (internal employees only)
- ‚úÖ Permission checks in Server Actions
- ‚úÖ Session-based authentication
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control (owner, admin, participant)

## üì¶ Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** - App Router, Server Components, Server Actions
- **React 19** - useOptimistic, useActionState, useTransition
- **Socket.io** - Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Drizzle ORM** - Type-safe database queries
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first styling
- **TypeScript** - End-to-end type safety
- **@dnd-kit** - Accessible drag-and-drop
- **Framer Motion** - Animations
- **NextAuth.js** - Authentication

## üöÄ Next Development Steps

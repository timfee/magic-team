# MagicRetro Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-13

A real-time multiplayer retrospective application built with Next.js 15, Socket.io, and PostgreSQL.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router, Turbopack), React 19
- NextAuth.js v5 (Google OAuth)
- PostgreSQL (GCP Cloud SQL) + Drizzle ORM
- Socket.io (real-time)
- TailwindCSS 4, Framer Motion, @dnd-kit
- TypeScript, Zod

## ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Database & Foundation
- Complete Drizzle schema (14 tables: users, sessions, categories, ideas, groups, comments, votes, settings, presence)
- Migrations generated and pushed to database
- TypeScript types for all entities
- Utility functions: permissions (RBAC), cn helper
- Cross-platform Cloud SQL Proxy setup

### Phase 2: Session Management
- Session CRUD with Server Actions (create, read, update, delete, add/remove admins)
- Ideas CRUD (create, read, update, delete, move to group)
- Comments CRUD (create, read, delete)
- Votes (cast, remove, get counts with rule validation)
- Permission system (owner, admin, participant)
- Visibility controls (public, private, protected)
- Homepage with session list
- Create session flow with category builder (1-10 categories)
- Session detail page

### Phase 3: Real-time Infrastructure
- Custom Node.js server with Socket.io
- WebSocket server with polling fallback
- Client connection manager with auto-reconnect
- Socket.io Provider wrapping the app
- Real-time events: session join/leave, stage changes, idea/group/comment/vote CRUD
- Connection status indicator
- Live presence tracking with user avatars
- Admin page (`/session/[id]/admin`) with stage management controls
- Real-time stage synchronization across all clients

- [ ] Image optimization
- [ ] Code splitting

**Error Handling**
- [ ] Retry logic for failed mutations
- [ ] Offline detection and queueing
- [ ] Conflict resolution UI
- [ ] Network error recovery

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Progressive Enhancement
✅ All features work without real-time (Server Actions)
✅ Socket.io adds real-time enhancements
✅ Polling fallback if WebSockets fail
✅ Manual refresh always available

### Data Flow
1. User action → Optimistic UI update (instant feedback)
2. Server Action → Database mutation (reliable)
3. Socket.io broadcast → Other users see update (real-time)
4. Fallback → Page refresh if Socket.io unavailable

### Security
- ✅ OAuth at audience level (internal employees only)
- ✅ Permission checks in Server Actions
- ✅ Session-based authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control

2. **Build Drag-and-Drop Grouping** - @dnd-kit integration, real-time sync, conflict handling
3. **Create Voting System** - Vote allocation UI, rules engine, real-time updates
4. **Build Presentation View** - Projector-optimized layout, follow admin's focus
5. **Add Polish** - Animations, loading states, error handling, accessibility

# MagicRetro Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-13

A real-time multiplayer retrospective application built with Next.js 15, Firebase Firestore.

## Tech Stack

- Migrations generated and pushed to database
- TypeScript types for all entities
- Utility functions: permissions (RBAC), cn helper
- Cross-platform Cloud SQL Proxy setup

### Phase 2: Session Management

- Session CRUD with Server Actions (create, read, update, delete, add/remove admins)
- Ideas CRUD (create, read, update, delete, move to group)
- Comments CRUD (create, read, delete)
- Votes (cast, remove, get counts with rule validation)
- Permission system (owner, admin, participant)
- Visibility controls (public, private, protected)
- Homepage with session list
- Create session flow with category builder (1-10 categories)
- Session detail page

### Phase 3: Real-time Infrastructure ✅ **MIGRATED TO FIREBASE**

- Firebase Firestore real-time subscriptions
- Client-side Firebase context with automatic reconnection

- Connection status automatically handled by Firebase
- Live presence tracking with user avatars
- Admin page (`/session/[id]/admin`) with stage management controls
- Real-time stage synchronization across all clients
- **Migration Complete:** Replaced Socket.io server with Firebase Firestore for serverless compatibility

### Phase 4: Stage-Specific UIs

- Idea Grouping stage - Drag-and-drop with real-time sync
- Idea Card component - Display individual ideas with vote counts
- Stage-based routing in SessionBoard
- Category-filtered idea display

- Vote rules enforcement (votes per user, per category, per idea)
- Optimistic UI updates for ideas and votes
- Drag-and-drop grouping with @dnd-kit
- Animated Facepile component with pop-in animations and continuous motion

### Progressive Enhancement

✅ All features work without real-time (Server Actions)
✅ Firebase Firestore adds real-time enhancements
✅ Automatic offline/online handling via Firebase
✅ Manual refresh always available

### Data Flow

1. User action → Server Action → Database mutation (reliable)
2. Firebase listener → Real-time update to all clients (automatic)
3. Fallback → Page refresh if Firebase unavailable

### Security

- ✅ OAuth at audience level (internal employees only)
- ✅ Permission checks in Server Actions
- ✅ Session-based authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control

### Firebase Migration (2025-10-13)

**Complete Socket.io → Firebase Migration:**

- Migrated all real-time functionality from Socket.io to Firebase Firestore
- Replaced custom WebSocket server with Firebase real-time subscriptions
- Updated all components to use Firebase context instead of Socket.io hooks
- Removed optimistic updates (Firebase handles real-time sync automatically)
- Eliminated custom server.ts requirement for full serverless compatibility
- Fixed all build errors and lint issues from incomplete migration
- Cleaned build artifacts to remove old Socket.io references

**Architecture Benefits:**

- **Serverless Ready:** No custom server needed, deploys to Vercel seamlessly
- **Improved Reliability:** Firebase handles connection management and offline states
- **Better Performance:** Direct Firestore connections with automatic conflict resolution
- **Simplified Codebase:** Removed complex optimistic update logic and event broadcasting

**Components Updated:**

- `components/connection-status.tsx` - Uses Firebase connection (always connected)
- `components/presence-tracker.tsx` - Real-time presence via Firebase context
- `components/session-wrapper.tsx` - Stage changes via Firebase subscriptions
- `app/session/[id]/session-content.tsx` - All real-time data from Firebase
- `app/session/[id]/admin/stage-controls.tsx` - Stage management via Firebase
- `app/session/[id]/components/stages/green-room.tsx` - User count from Firebase
- `app/session/[id]/components/stages/idea-collection.tsx` - Real-time ideas from Firebase

## 🐛 Recent Fixes

### Simplified Drag-and-Drop Grouping (2025-10-13)

**Core Features:**

- Auto-group creation: Drag ungrouped ideas onto each other to instantly create a group with a random name
- Add to existing groups: Drag any card onto another card in a group to join that group
- Move between groups: Drag a card from one group to another group by dropping on any card in target group
- Auto-delete empty groups: When you drag the last card out of a group, the group is automatically removed
- Color preservation: Cards maintain their original category color (categoryId never changes after creation)
- Single-category groups: Each group lives in one category (like TeamRetro)
- Three-column category view: Each category shows its ungrouped ideas and groups

**Visual Feedback (Crystal Clear Drop Targets):**

- Contextual indicators on hover:
  - Both ungrouped → Gradient glow + "Will create group"
  - One ungrouped, one grouped → Blue ring + "Will join this group"
  - Both grouped (different groups) → Blue ring + "Will move to this group"
  - Same group → No indicator (no-op)
- Ghost placeholders: Blue dashed boxes with "Will add here" or "Will ungroup here" in drop zones
- Drop zones: Thick blue ring (ring-4) + blue background on hover over groups and ungrouped zones
- Context-aware empty zone messaging: "Drop here to ungroup" when dragging FROM a group; "Drop ideas here" otherwise
- Ungrouped zones are functional drop targets: Drag a grouped card to any empty ungrouped area to ungroup it
- Drag overlay: Shadow-2xl with 0.3 opacity on source card for clear visual hierarchy
- No snap-back: Cards smoothly transition to their final position

**Technical Implementation:**

- Fixed hydration mismatch by rendering DnD only after client mount (prevents SSR ID conflicts)
- Collision detection with `closestCorners` for idea-on-idea drops
- Simplified `handleDragEnd` with 4 cases for idea-on-idea:
  1. Both ungrouped → create new group in first idea's category
  2. Target grouped, active ungrouped → add active to target's group
  3. Active grouped, target ungrouped → add target to active's group
  4. Both grouped (different) → move active to target's group + auto-delete source if empty
- UngroupedDropZone component using `useDroppable` for functional drop targets
- dropIndicator prop with 3 states: "create-group", "join-group", "move-to-group"
- Random group title generator with adjectives + nouns (e.g., "Brilliant Solutions")
- Optimistic UI updates with smooth transitions
- Real-time broadcast of all grouping operations via Socket.io
- Auto-delete empty groups after last card is removed
- Ideas never change categoryId (color preservation)
- Groups belong to single category (simpler model like TeamRetro)

## 🐛 Known Issues

None currently - all build errors resolved, complete Firebase migration successful, all lint warnings cleaned.
